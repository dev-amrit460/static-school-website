<p align="center">Delhi Public School Society is one of the largest chains of K-12 schools in the world with over 150 schools in India<br> and foreign shores. The first DPS School, DPS Mathura Road, was established in 1947 <br>and since then the society has been adding world-class educational institutions all over India and abroad.<br>

Takshila Educational Society was set up in 1997 with the explicit objective of establishing educational institutions<br> which would offer holistic education. DPS Patna was the first milestone but certainly not the last.<br> The Takshila Society strove to make its presence felt in the four directions and consequently DPS Schools were established in Pune,<br> Ludhiana and Coimbatore. Excellent Scholastic and Co Scholastic achievements year after year have made <br>these schools create their own niche.<br>
