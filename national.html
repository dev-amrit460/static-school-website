<p align="left"><font color="red">The e-Governance in India has steadily evolved from computerization of Government Departments<br> to initiatives that encapsulate the finer points of Governance, such as citizen centricity,<br> service orientation and transparency. Lessons from previous e-Governance initiatives have played an important role<br> in shaping the progressive e-Governance strategy of the country. Due cognizance has been taken of the notion that to speed up e-Governance implementation<br> across the various arms of Government at National, State, and Local levels, a programme approach needs to be adopted, guided by common vision <br>and strategy. This approach has the potential of enabling huge savings in costs through sharing of core and support infrastructure,<br> enabling interoperability through standards, and of presenting a seamless view of Government to citizens.
