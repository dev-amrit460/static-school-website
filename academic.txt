<p align="center">DPS Patna is affiliated to CBSE, New Delhi. The curriculum followed in junior and senior classes is based on NCERT<br>
guidelines, albeit with several innovations which are introduced after much research and study.<br>
The Pre-Primary teaching broadly uses the Play Way Method to teach the curriculum. Through this method, teachers<br>
facilitate students to understand basic concepts of language and numbers thus giving them the first lessons in Life Skills.<br>
The Play Way Method is further reinforced by hands-on activities conducted in and out of the classroom. Field Trips, Nature<br>
Walks, Celebrations of Festivals, Topic-based Projects, and Science Experiments form a regular and integral part of<br>
learning-through-doing.<br><br>
Till class III the curriculum is theme-based. The idea behind this is to seamlessly integrate various subjects with a common<br>
thread which links them to practical aspect of life. This gives our students a holistic view and allows them to apply<br>
knowledge and correlate various subjects to real-life situations.<br></p>
